        <h3>About the legend</h3>
<h3>
        <p>
            ☛Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was an Indian aerospace scientist and politician
            who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007.
            He played a crucial role in India's civilian space program and military missile development.
        </p>
        <p>
            ☛ Dr. Kalam was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, and passed away
            on <strong>July 27, 2015</strong>.</p>
        <p> ☛His contributions to science, education, and humanity continue to
            inspire people around the world.</p>
        <p>☛ From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal
            scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. </p>
        <p> ☛His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and
            established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international
            community. </p>
        <p>☛In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map
            for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. </p>
        <p>☛The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a
            vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.</p>
        <p>☛In 2002 India’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put forward Kalam to succeed outgoing President
            Kocheril Raman Narayanan.
            Kalam was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) NDA even though he was Muslim, and his stature and
            popular appeal were such that even the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, also proposed
            his candidacy. </p>
        <p>☛Kalam easily won the election and was sworn in as India’s 11th president, a largely ceremonial post, in July
            2002.
            He left office at the end of his term in 2007 and was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country’s first woman
            president.</p>
        <p>☛Upon returning to civilian life, Kalam remained committed to using science and technology to transform India
            into a developed country and served as a lecturer at several universities. On July 27, 2015, he collapsed
            while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong and was pronounced dead from
            cardiac arrest soon afterward.</p>
        <p>☛Kalam wrote several books, including an autobiography, Wings of Fire (1999). Among his numerous awards were
            two of the country’s highest honours, the Padma Vibhushan (1990) and the Bharat Ratna (1997).</p>
